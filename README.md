# Appointments Scheduling System

1. A service agent should be able to add, update and delete appointment.
2. When adding a new appointment/s is to check if there is any conflict with an existing
appointment and return the proper error message such as SamePeriod, OverlapsWith and
IntersectsWith.
3. It would be valuable if you can provide unit/integration tests
